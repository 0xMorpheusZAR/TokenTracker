## What the fresh data means for the bull case

### 1.  Network‑effect momentum is accelerating

*Hyperliquid already clears almost two‑thirds of the **entire** decentralised perps market*, processing **\$186 B this month alone** — five times its nearest rival and roughly **10 % of Binance’s total derivatives flow**. Liquidity begets liquidity, and these volumes translate into the **tightest spreads and deepest order books on‑chain**, reinforcing the moat. ([dlnews.com][2], [defillama.com][1])

### 2.  Revenue quality & “real yield” are scaling with usage

At an **\$830 M run‑rate in fees** and **\$772 M flowing to token‑holders and vault depositors**, Hyperliquid is generating CEX‑level cash flow without taking a cent for the core team. That cash‑flow‑to‑FDV ratio (≈ 2.1 %) is already inside the range of large listed exchanges — rare for a two‑year‑old DeFi protocol. ([defillama.com][1])

### 3.  Open‑interest depth rivals mid‑tier CEXs

Aggregate OI sits above **\$7 B**, with **BTC alone at \$1.4 B**, equal to 15 % of Binance and nearly half of OKX. Deep OI reduces slippage for large directional traders and entices systematic funds that were previously CeFi‑only. ([coingecko.com][4], [blockworks.co][3])

### 4.  User distribution remains uniquely “anti‑VC”

Over **510 k wallets** have traded on‑chain, and \~70 % of HYPE supply is community‑owned. No large VC unlocks loom, eliminating the chronic sell pressure that dogs low‑float/high‑FDV launches. That alignment is a branding asset in the current market backlash against VC‑heavy tokenomics. ([stats.hyperliquid.xyz][5])

### 5.  Operating leverage is still ahead

Even after tripling since launch, HYPE’s FDV (\~\$37 B) prices in a **price/revenue multiple close to Coinbase’s** despite much faster top‑line growth. If average daily volume merely holds the recent **\$6.4 B** and fee schedules stay constant, annual revenue could breach **\$1 B** within 12 months — leaving room for upside if share rises above the current 62 % of perp‑DEX flow. ([blockworks.co][3], [defillama.com][1])

## Updated long‑term thesis, distilled

1. **CeFi‑grade experience, DeFi trust paradigm.** A fully on‑chain order book clearing >\$6 B/day with sub‑second finality remains unmatched.
2. **Flywheel is real and measurable.** Each new user (now > 0.5 M) deepens liquidity, which in turn raises volumes, fees and vault yields — hard numbers confirm the loop.
3. **Incentives are user‑centric.** 100 % of trading fees accrue to community vaults or insurance; no venture drag.
4. **Dominance is widening, not plateauing.** June’s 62 % share and 10 % of Binance’s flow show migration from CeFi to on‑chain is underway, and Hyperliquid is the primary beneficiary.
5. **Valuation is increasingly justified by cash flow.** At current run‑rate, Hyperliquid already prints revenues on par with some publicly traded exchanges valued at similar or higher multiples.

**Bottom line:** the newest metrics reinforce every pillar of the bull case — liquidity network effects, revenue growth, token‑holder alignment and market‑share expansion. Unless a rival can simultaneously match throughput, fee structure, and fair tokenomics, Hyperliquid’s lead is likely to compound through the next market cycle.
